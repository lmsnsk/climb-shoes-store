            "By combining the best features of the Instinct Slipper and Lace shoes with some refinements, tweaks and improvements, the Scarpa Instinct VS is a serious contender as one of the best high-end performance climbing shoes available. As with the slipper version, the Instinct VS is entirely constructed from synthetic fabric. However, the more substantial (strapped) upper, stiff midsole and high coverage of rubber means the Scarpa Instinct VS does hold its size and shape considerably better than either of its namesakes",

Whereas the Furia was designed as a soft performance climbing shoe for most angles and terrains, the Drago has been designed principally with steep terrain in mind and targeted at high-end bouldering and sport climbing, where maximum control and sensitivity are required",
